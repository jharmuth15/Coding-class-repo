  <h3>Welcome to the land of Vindinium!</h3>
<body>
<p>
  <div id="introp">
  Four legendary heroes were fighting for the land of Vindinium <br>
Making their way in the dangerous woods <br>
Slashing goblins and stealing gold mines <br>
And looking for a tavern where to drink away their gold <br>

  <h3> Basic rules:</h3>
  <p>
  Steps into a gold mine, he stays in place, and:

    <li>If the mine already belongs to the hero, nothing happens.</li> <br>

<li>If the mine is neutral, or belongs to another hero, a fight happens against the goblin guarding the mine. The hero loses 20 life points. If he survives, the mine is his.</li> <br>
    <li>Steps into another hero, he stays in place and nothing happens. Hero fights are resolved at the end of the turn. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
Steps into a tavern, he stays in place and orders a beer. The hero pays 2 gold and receive 50HP. Note than HP can never exceed 100.
    </li>
    
  </p>
    <h3>What does my bot do?</h3>
    <p> My bot does the following: </p>
    <li>When there are enemy mines that aren't owned it goes for those first.</li>
    <li>Once there are no more mines that aren't owned, it goes for mines that are owned by enemies.</li>
    <li>Once health is below 30, it goes to the tavern to refill</li>
    <li>However, all of these are ignored when and enemy has a health below 32.  It then follows that bot and attempts to kill it.</li>
