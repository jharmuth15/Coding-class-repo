<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>The different parts of a computer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motherboard</li>
<li>CPU</li>
<li>RAM</li>
<li>hard drive</li>
<li>power supply</li>
<li>keyboard</li>
<li>mouse</li>
<li>monitor</li>
</ul>

<h4>Motherboard</h4>
<p>The motherboard is a circuit board where the principal components of a compute with connectors into which other circuit boards can be slotted.  This is the backbone of the computer.

<h4>CPU</h4>
<p>CPU stands for central processing unit.  The CPU is the brain of your computer. CPU's follow instructions given from your computer

<h4>RAM</h4>
<p>RAM stand for "Random Access Memory."  Every time you open a program, it loads from the hard drive into the RAM.

<h4> Hard Drive</h4>
<p>Hard drive's are self-contained storage device inside a somputer containing a read-write mechanism.  This is the most popular piece of a computer.

<h4>Power Supply</h4>
<p>A power supply is a device that gives electric power to a place that needs electricity.  Think of it as a plug to an outlet.</p>

<h4>Monitor</h4>
<p>The screen of a computer.  The monitor displays what is happening.  It displays websites, what you're typing, and where the mouse is moving.

<h4>How do the different components communicate with one another?</h4>
<p>Computer components communicate to each other via connections known as a 'bus' on the motherboard. Because multiple devices can communicate to the same bus, the communications are handled by the 'bus controller'.  These are then spread across all parts of the computer, starting from the omtherboard
